My name is Cynthia and I am the proud owner of B&G Luxury\n            Empire in the North York Area, Toronto. Canada. Since I pursued\n            being an estheticians, it was definitely not easy for me. There were\n            times where I wanted to give up or quit, but I am glad I didnâ€™t\n            because years later, I love my job and everyone I met along the way.\n            <br />\n            <br /> The experience and the relationships that are built in this\n            industry are unbelievable. I am very thankful for my clients and our\n            spa dates because without their trust and time spent during our\n            sessions, I would not be where I am today. Lastly, I have had the\n            pleasure to work and teach hard working and dream driven ladies who\n            I call my family, the #b&gluxuryempire.\n          </p>\n          <Link to=\"/contact\" className=\"btn\">\n            Contact\n          </Link>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default About\n"],"names":["className","S","src","alt","placeholder","size","to"],"sourceRoot":""}
