Also known as body polish,it consists of a liquid base with exfoliating granules which slough off dead skin when you massage it over your body. This action boosts blood circulation and drains your lymph nodes by increasing the blood flow to your skin’s surface. Sugar, salt and walnut shell powder are popular exfoliating components in natural body scrubs as they are abrasive enough to scrub skin but gentle enough to not damage it."},"prepTime":5,"serving":40,"image":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/0v6no6dvhwuo/3I3JOcrRLKLg3rMh2ycPug/d11a89bf0244a8f31d2566a83237431a/Body_Scrub_250ml.jpg?w=1333&h=934&q=50&fm=webp 1333w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/0v6no6dvhwuo/3I3JOcrRLKLg3rMh2ycPug/d11a89bf0244a8f31d2566a83237431a/Body_Scrub_250ml.jpg?w=2666&h=1869&q=50&fm=webp 2666w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/0v6no6dvhwuo/3I3JOcrRLKLg3rMh2ycPug/d11a89bf0244a8f31d2566a83237431a/Body_Scrub_250ml.jpg?w=4000&h=2803&q=50&fm=webp 4000w","sizes":"(min-width: 5332px) 5332px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/0v6no6dvhwuo/3I3JOcrRLKLg3rMh2ycPug/d11a89bf0244a8f31d2566a83237431a/Body_Scrub_250ml.jpg?w=1333&h=934&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/0v6no6dvhwuo/3I3JOcrRLKLg3rMh2ycPug/d11a89bf0244a8f31d2566a83237431a/Body_Scrub_250ml.jpg?w=1333&h=934&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 1333w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/0v6no6dvhwuo/3I3JOcrRLKLg3rMh2ycPug/d11a89bf0244a8f31d2566a83237431a/Body_Scrub_250ml.jpg?w=2666&h=1869&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 2666w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/0v6no6dvhwuo/3I3JOcrRLKLg3rMh2ycPug/d11a89bf0244a8f31d2566a83237431a/Body_Scrub_250ml.jpg?w=4000&h=2803&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 4000w","sizes":"(min-width: 5332px) 5332px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":5332,"height":3737,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='281'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20281'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M208%2081c-1%202-12%203-18%202h-7l-4%203-3%201v72l1%2073c4%203%2036%203%2039%200%201-1%202-143%200-145l-2-1c-3%200-6-2-5-4%201-1%200-1-1-1'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ea0e5f72-9ac0-59b9-9cea-2d585aed6f92","title":"Body Scrub - 250ml","__params":{"title":"body-scrub-250ml"}}},
