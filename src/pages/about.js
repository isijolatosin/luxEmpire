            Hi there! My name is Cynthia and I am the proud owner of B&G Luxury
            Empire in the North York Area, Toronto. Canada. Since I pursued
            being an estheticians, it was definitely not easy for me. There were
            times where I wanted to give up or quit, but I am glad I didnâ€™t
            because years later, I love my job and everyone I met along the way.
            <br />
            <br /> The experience and the relationships that are built in this
            industry are unbelievable. I am very thankful for my clients and our
            spa dates because without their trust and time spent during our
            sessions, I would not be where I am today. Lastly, I have had the
            pleasure to work and teach hard working and dream driven ladies who
            I call my family, the #b&gluxuryempire.
